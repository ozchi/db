Q3: Review the data in "movies.nt". You can use any text editor to open this file. You don't have to use Python scripts for this question, you can just use search in a text editor or Unix command line tools.

List all genre names (e.g., Action, Comedy, etc.) for the movie represented by the blank node _:m_228161.

Q4: Consider the following sentence: "Adelaide is the state capital of South Australia" (you knew that, right?). Encode this information in N-Triples format. Appropriately use blank nodes, URIs and string literals. Note that the sentence has some implied information that also needs to be included (e.g., what is South Australia? Do you need to provide more context for how you just described South Australia?).

You can use "movies.nt" as a reference. Paste your answer here, rather rather than creating a new .nt file.
